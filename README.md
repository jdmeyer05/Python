Python Code

All of the code here are personal projects that I want to share. I have shared a few academic assignments as well.

Options_Visualizations
  - I wanted to be able to see options Open Interest and Implied Vol across three axes. IV or OI, Contract Month, Strike.
  - This code, because it is plotly, which is amazing for visualizations, allows for the 3d charts to be rotated, panned and scaled.
  
QQQ_Intraday_Price_Analysis
  - Back in Feb 2022, a CPI report caused the markets to produce a special day. There was more volume (shares traded) on this day than any day going back at least a decade or more. So I pulled all the volume data back as far as possible and ran some analysis and visualizations. This visualization is also what is in my Medium.com article.

Simple_HyperOpt_Trading_Algo
  - I put a great deal of time into this over several months. Once I procured price data on a basket of high-volume stocks at the 1min level, I wanted to try various technical trading strategies and see which combinations at which time interval (i.e., 1min/5min/30min/1hr) produced alpha over a given period. The HyperOpt function is something I learned from my Deep Learning course. This is used to optimize Hyper Parameters for Deep Learning models. However, this function works with anything you want. So I deployed the idea mentioned above to fine-tune each of the technical parameters (across all dimensions of these parameters) to give the most reliable alpha-generating trading strategy I could. 
  - In the future, I plan on using this to backtest more sophisticated trading strategies like statistical arbitrage and using machine learning to make feature reduction for creating trading models that pull in hundreds of dimensions. 

DeepLearning Midterm
  - This is an example of an image recognition deep learning model using Keras
  
Machine Learning - KNN
  - An example of a KNN assignment I completed
  
 Machine Learning - Naive Bayes_KNN
  - An example of a comparison assignment comparing the Naive Bayes method against K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  
Correlation Analysis
  - This is some code I pulled from the internet for correlation analysis. I modified several parts to fit my needs. Just an example of something I have used to get a better understanding of relationships between various stocks and ETFs before I add them to my portfolio.
