Python Code

All of the code here are personal projects that I want to share. I have several academic projects I can share as well which I made do in the future.

Options_Visualizations
  - I wanted to be able to see options Open Interest and Implied Vol across three axis. IV or OI, Contract Month, Strike
  
QQQ_Intraday_Price_Analysis
  - Back in Feb 2022 a CPI report caused the markets to produce a very unique day. There was more volume (shares traded) on this day than any day going back at least a decade or more. So i pulled all of the volume data going back as far as I could and ran some analysis and visualizations on it. This is also what is in my Medium.com article.

Simple_HyperOpt_Trading_Algo
  - I put a great deal of time into this over several months. Once I procured price data on a basket of high volume stocks at the 1min level I wanted to try a variety of technical trading strategies and see which combinations at which time interval (i.e. 1min/5min/30min/1hr) produced alpha over a given period of time. They HyperOpt function is something I learned from my Deep Learning course. This is used to optimized Hyper Parameters for Deep Learning models. However, this funtion works with anything you want really. So I deployed it on the above mentioned idea to fine tune each of the techincal parameters (across all dimentions of these paramters) to give the most reliable alpha generating trading strategy I could. 
  - In the future I plan on using this to back test more sophisticated trading stratgies like statisical arbitrage and using machine learning to do feature reduction for creating trading models that pull in hundred of dimensions. 

DeepLearning Midterm
  - This is an example of the an image recognition deep learning model using Keras
  
Machine Learning - KNN
  - An example of a KNN assignment I completed
  
 Machine Learning - Naive Bayes_KNN
  - An example of a comparison assignment comparing Naive Bayes method against K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
